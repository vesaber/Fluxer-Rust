# Fluxer-rs
A Fluxer API Wrapper written in Rust.

#### ⚠️ This library is still in development, expect issues or functions that don't exist yet. I'm trying my best to get everything implemented. Docs will also come, though I might get help from a friend with this

# Contribute

Contributions are very very welcome especially when the library is very early in development.
A quick guide on how to contribute will come very quickly im just too tired to do it right now.
